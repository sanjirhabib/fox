# Speed Comparison Test
A bunch of micro benchmarks.

Recursive fibonacci calculations programs in different languages.
Fox apps provide fastest speed, at lower binary and source size.
Which is not surprising as fox code is just C.

The real diffrence starts to appear in GC and string/vector/map operations.
Which should be benchmarked here instead.
